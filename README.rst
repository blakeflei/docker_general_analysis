Docker Template for Generic Analysis 
====================================

Borrowed extremely heavily from `Jupyter Docker Stacks <https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks>`__ this project builds the jupyter/datascience-notebook, abstracting the conda and pip libraries as separate files and can archive them for future offline installs. This way, future docker builds can employ the same software packages for repeatability.

Also downloads and installs PyCharm.
